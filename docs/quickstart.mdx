## Get started in three steps

Get your running locally to make your changes. The best way to do this is following each step in order; laying a good foundation here will pay dividends. Make sure you have a good understanding of the steps before you move on to the next one.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="copy">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the preview server" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

    <Tip>
      Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" icon="github">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update your site name and colors" icon="palette">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion title="Publish your docs" icon="rocket">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
